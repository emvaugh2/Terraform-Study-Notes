# Terraform-Study-Notes


**Greetings! So I'm finally done with my Docker studies. I'm going to focus on Terraform next because there just isn't a ton of resources on A Cloud Guru for it. So I think it will be quick. I'm going to be focusing on Python and Azure projects after that for quite some time. So once again, I'll be publicly documenting my notes. You definitely need Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud and DevOps practices so lets get the cloud-agnostic tool ready to go.

**Today's Topics**

* Hashicorp Certified Terraform Associate

So, I'll be going through this course because there just aren't a ton of Terraform courses on A Cloud Guru. I may do Terraform with Azure as well but we'll see. I'm not testing for any certifications so I'll strictly be watching the videos and completing the labs.
